to write a shell command in Jenkins script  
sh 'command'  

to run something at the end of the pipeline/stage  
use  
```groovy
post{
    always{}    //always runs what in it wether build fails or succeeds
    success{}   //runs only when build success
	failure{}   //always runs what int it when the buidl fails
}

```

to clear the work directory
`cleanWs()`

to save artifacts  
`archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'path'`

to add environment variables add the next block to the pipeline  
```groovy
environment{
    variableName = value
}
```
to use the variable use a `$` before it's name(ahh bash)  

to use a docker image put this block in the stage where it is needed  
```groovy
agent{
    docker{
        image 'image:tag'
        
    }
}
```

to reuse the docker image add `reuseNode true`
to run as root add `args '--user root'`
## how to run stages in parallel
```groovy
stage('name') {
	parallel {
		stage('first stage'){}
		stage('second stage'){}
	}
}
```
