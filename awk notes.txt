Basic Syntax
You can use awk in two ways:
With a command pipeline:
	command | awk 'awk_command'
With a file:
	awk 'awk_command' file

Changing Field Separator
	Use -F "separator" to change the field separator.
		Example: awk -F ":" '{print $1}' file
	Alternatively, define field separators inside awk:
		Example: awk 'BEGIN {FS=":"} {print $1}' file

Pattern Matching
	/pattern/ is used to search for a pattern in a file.
		^ matches the beginning of every line.
		Use \ to escape special characters in patterns.

Printing Specific Fields
To output a specific column:
	awk '{print $columnNumber}' file
		Example: awk '{print $2}' file prints the second column.
To output multiple columns:
	awk '{print $column1, $column2, $column3}' file
To separate columns with a custom separator:
	awk '{print $1, "-", $2}' file

To define separators explicitly:
	awk 'BEGIN {FS=":"; OFS="-"} {print $1, $2, $3}' file

Printing the Last Field
	To print the last field in a line, use $NF:
		awk '{print $NF}' file
to get the length of a line use the length($column_number)
